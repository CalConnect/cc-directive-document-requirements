== Introduction

CalConnect is committed in expanding the realm of standards
in collaborative technologies with a focus on interoperability
across the globe and communities of practice.

To facilitate its mission, the CalConnect Board of Directors has decided
to align standardization and publication processes with international
best practices, such as the ISO standardization process
(<<ISODIR1>>, <<ISODIR1C>>, <<ISODIR2>>)
and the <<WTOTBT>>.

This document aims to achieve the said intention.

The document describes requirements for CalConnect standard documents.
